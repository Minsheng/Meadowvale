This is orginally a Software Engineering course project in
Univeristy of Toronto, started on Jan., 2010.
It is developed by Team Sierra, which consists of
Jiaxian(Eric) Yao, Josh Zucker, Minsheng(Davidson) Zheng, and Xiao(Vance) Wei.

Briefly saying, this application serves to manage student co-op
activities. Students as users fill out and submit weekly log journal
as electronic forms through this application. Teachers as administrators
approve or manage those submitted log journals.
All the data were designed to store into a local MySQL database.
The end users will be able to access to the data 
through a front-end GUI. More technical details such as step-by-step 
user tasks of each feature and INSTALLATION GUIDE can be found
in "Meadowvale User Manual.pdf." The software architecture overview can
be found as "Meadowvale Software Architecture."

We have also provided some step-by-step instructions on how to test our
application. You can find the file as "Test Instructions.txt."
